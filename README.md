In the following introductory text, I quoted the format of the introductory part of EdgarFx's CUHKSZ-CSC3100-EdgarFei project, with only a few modifications. I would like to express my gratitude to him in advance.

To memorize the assignments I have done. It would be great if it can help the students in need (remember not to copy directly, personally suggest that if you have no ideas, you can look at the code here to find ideas, and then try to write it in your own way). Here are all the codes and reports of my four projects in the CSC3100 course. Most of the codes are implemented using C++, only 1 question done in Python. The scores of my four assignments are all full marks, you should be able to rest assured (but not sure if there are bugs that have not been tested).
